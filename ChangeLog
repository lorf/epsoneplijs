   . Documentation and script addition about flowcontrol=nowhere
   . rough work on "print as much as possible on low mem". Also
     checking in new postscript code for turning on well-tempered
     screening in ghostscript 8.00+.
	
2004-09-16: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . A lot of 6200L-read interpretation updates; switch 6100L to use
     6200L read interpretation.
   . abort compilation on any warning.
   . finish long-overdue nowhere-bid write functionality for
     similating mis-understood/failed read.
   . a lot of fixes with buggy read/polling.
   . relaxed b/w restriction in preparation for future 
     dithering improvements.

2004-09-13: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . x86_64 platform issue: shared libraries requires -fPIC
     to build. Removed libijs.so and the original ijs*example* targets
     from makefiles. We link statically with libieee1284 or libusb
     as always, so there is no need to do anything about these two.
	
2004-06-18: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . update IJS component to 0.35
	
2004-06-02: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung

2003-09-14: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Ooops, forgot to activate the polling on 6100L.

2003-09-10: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . Added prelimary null transport skeleton code to debug bid problems.

   . Added epl_61interpret.c.
   . First attempt to do (free mem) flow control on 6100L.

2003-09-04: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Unified all sleeping functions into sleep_seconds(double s).
   . We try to accurately detect how big is the buffer of the printer
     (this will be useful for future enhancements).
   . Flow control is now more cleanly integrated. At the moment
     there are two speed limiters: a stripe to stripe delay
     (used only for 5700L) and a closed-loop free mem delay
     (5800L, 5900L only; it should work for 5700L too but it's
     disabled because htl doesn't want it :-) ).
   . The free mem flow control now uses a better estimation
     algorithm.
   . Small misc fixes (code style, debug output).
   . Added epl_time.c, a lot of code has been moved around.

2003-07-18: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . fixing the autoconf code to detect correctly kernel versions of the form
     "2.4.21-0.13mdk" (extra dot) reported for mandrake 9.x.

2003-04-11: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Added adaptive flow control algorithm for 5800L/5900L/6100L
     (5700L unchanged). It appears to be rock solid, according to
     first tests.
   . Printer replies are now interpreted and logged (if debug is on) for
     5800L/5900L. 5700L and 6100L need some work to implement that.
   . epl_test.sh can be run without having to "make install".
   . Misc fixes and moved some code around.

2003-04-10: cvs - Roberto Ragusa

        configure now accepts --with-kerneldevice,--with-libusb
   . documentation update regarding USB and the 4-bit code.
   * !!Changed behavior!!:
        reverting "USB=on" in ps2epl to "off", as there is now
        two ways of doing 5700L USB printing.

   . Added minimal FAQ.
   * !!Changed behavior!!:
