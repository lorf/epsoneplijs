2003-09-08: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Added epl_61interpret.c.
   . First attempt to do (free mem) flow control on 6100L.

2003-09-04: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Unified all sleeping functions into sleep_seconds(double s).
   . We try to accurately detect how big is the buffer of the printer
     (this will be useful for future enhancements).
   . Flow control is now more cleanly integrated. At the moment
     there are two speed limiters: a stripe to stripe delay
     (used only for 5700L) and a closed-loop free mem delay
     (5800L, 5900L only; it should work for 5700L too but it's
     disabled because htl doesn't want it :-) ).
   . The free mem flow control now uses a better estimation
     algorithm.
   . Small misc fixes (code style, debug output).
   . Added epl_time.c, a lot of code has been moved around.

2003-07-18: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . fixing the autoconf code to detect correctly kernel versions of the form
     "2.4.21-0.13mdk" (extra dot) reported for mandrake 9.x.  

2003-05-07: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Small fixes.

2003-05-04: cvs - Roberto Ragusa

2003-04-11: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Added adaptive flow control algorithm for 5800L/5900L/6100L
     (5700L unchanged). It appears to be rock solid, according to
     first tests.
   . Printer replies are now interpreted and logged (if debug is on) for
     5800L/5900L. 5700L and 6100L need some work to implement that.
   . epl_test.sh can be run without having to "make install".
   . Misc fixes and moved some code around.

2003-04-10: cvs - Roberto Ragusa
   . Direct USB ("FlowControl") is now available for all printers.

        The "USB" parameter is now called "FlowControl".
   . FlowControl option added to foomatic (5700L only).
   . Fixed Density default (now 3 for 5700L/5800L too).

2003-03-18: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . Updated flow-control timing code. Can do 20 pages via libusb now.
   . removed some over-verbose debug outputs, added page number output.
   . Added apsfilter contrib setup.

2003-02-28: cvs - Hin-Tak Leung
   . Merged in USB-related code, 
        configure now accepts --with-kerneldevice,--with-libusb
   . documentation update regarding USB and the 4-bit code.
   * !!Changed behavior!!:
        reverting "USB=on" in ps2epl to "off", as there is now
        two ways of doing 5700L USB printing.

   . Added minimal FAQ.
   * !!Changed behavior!!: 
        ps2epl now has "TonerSave=on", and also "USB=on" for 5700L.  
        All users should try to use CUPS/etc, while the script should be 
        reserved for testing purposes. Edit to get old behaviour.
