What is this?
===========
  This project is named "epsonepl".
  It is a printer driver which gives ghostscript the ability
  to print to Epson EPL-5700L, EPL-5800L, EPL-5900L laser printers.
  EPL-6100L could work too (maybe with little modifications), but nobody
  tested it yet (volunteers wanted!).

Requirement
===========
  Type "gs -h" to get your ghostscript version and device list. You need 
  GNU ghostscript 6.53+ or AFPL Ghostscript 7.04+, and the "ijs" device 
  listed among the device list to use this plugin.

  The ijs part in AFPL ghostscript 8.00 (and all devel versions of gs 
  between v. 7.22 - 8.00) has a bug which has been reported.
  The fix is in our mailing list archive and requires recompiling ghostscript
  itself. Please wait for the fix to be officially incorporated into ghostscript,
  and avoid using unmodified stock gs v. 7.22 -8.00, and any newer versions, 
  until further notice. 

  The kernel device code (./configure --with-kerneldevice) switches on code 
  portions which depends on features of the linux kernel only found in 2.4.19+ 
  or 2.5.7+ onwards. The default is auto (enables if the host is linux and 
  the kernel suitably suitably recent).

  The libusb USB code    (./configure --with-libusb) switches on code 
  portions which depends on libusb. The default is auto (enables if "libusb"
  is either a symbolic link to or an actual directory of the libusb source.) 

Installation
============

  ./configure
  make
  make install

  (be sure /usr/local/bin is in your path, if it isn't, try with 
  "./configure --prefix=/usr")

  Note for maintainers, distributors, expert users:
  epl_config.h contains some compile-time options, please have
  a look at it.

  Check the content of the script "README.foomatic" in this source 
  bundle for notes on foomatic and cups. Check the "cups" directory for 
  contributed cups ppd files. Check the "apsfilter" directory for 
  apsfilter setup.

  Read the "FAQ" file, and also browse the mailing list archive (link at 
  the bottom of http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/)  for frequently 
  asked questions that has been asked before.

Usage
=====
  See ps2epl for selectable options. Change "EPL5700L" to "EPL5800L", 
  or "EPL5900L" where appropriate.

  Testing: Print using "./ps2epl myfile.ps" and "cat myfile.epl >/dev/lp0",
  or in one step: "./ps2epl myfile.ps /dev/lp0"
  
  Alternatively, if your system is based on foomatic, have a look at the 
  README.foomatic file and foomatic dir.

License
=======
  The ijs-derived part follows the same licence as ijs. The rest of the code 
  is under the GNU public license, except "epl_compress.c".

  As of version 0.2.3, the usb branch has merged back to the main branch,
  and we no longer bundle libusb as a sub-directory within the source bundle. 
  The src rpm still includes a libusb tar ball and recreates a sub-directory 
  during rpm building, for convenience.

  The content of "epl_compress.c" may have issues with Epson which we are 
  not yet sure about. Therefore we hereby explicitly ask whoever uses the 
  content of that file, NOT to use it for any purpose other than in relation  
  to the Epson EPL series of printers.

Notes
=====
  Almost all the files came as it was from the ijs-0.34 distribution, except
