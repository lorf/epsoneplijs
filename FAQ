Requirement
===========
  Type "gs -h" to get your ghostscript version and device list. You need 
  GNU ghostscript 6.53+ or AFPL Ghostscript 7.04+, and the "ijs" device 
  listed among the device list to use this plugin.

  There is a bug with ghostscript 7.22 - 8.14 inclusive. The symptom is 
  that the page comes out all black. Either used the patched 8.00 binary
  on our project page http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/,
  recompile your own with the patch, or upgrade to 8.14+ or downgrade to 7.07-.

USB on 5700L
============
  Printing via USB connectivity to the 5700L is supported via two
  mechanisms: the generic Linux kernel device, or via the libusb package.
  Support for both can be compiled in together, but they are mutually 
  exclusive at runtime - the kernel device requires the kernel module 
  "printer.o" loaded, while the libusb code requires the kernel module not
  loaded. The former mechanism is more compatible with the rest of Linux's
  USB sub-system, but it is quite linux-specific. The latter is probably
  more portable (libusb has been ported to FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin
  MacOS X).

  The kernel device code is probably best trouble-shoot through syslogs, etc.

  As for the libusb code, if you see "can't claim USB device" and got 
  directed here, you need to check a few things concerning permissions:

  (1) /proc/bus/usb is mounted, 

  (2) the person running the plugin has read/write privilege to most of the 
      files under there. 

  (3) the kernel printer class driver "printer" is NOT loaded (running 
      "lsmod" does NOT list "printer"). The kernel driver does not provide 
      access mechanism sophisticated enough for this printer to work,
      so loading the driver only interferes with the plugin's operation.

      Beware that some systems may autoload the kernel driver at boot-up 
      time and when the printer is switched on or reconnected. If your
      system is running hotplug you can add a line with "printer" (no
      extra spaces!) to /etc/hotplug/blacklist, so it will not be
      autoloaded anymore.
   
   There is a test5700lusb binary in libusb/tests/ which would get the 5700L
   connected via USB to spit out a blank page. Run it before reporting
   any problems, and please attach the whole of testlibusb's output
   (it scans your USB and output every piece of info it finds)
   when you report problems.

USB on 5800L, 5900L, 6100L, 6200L
==========================
  USB support has been recently extended to all printers. If you want to try
  it, just follow the same instructions given for 5700L.
  This is experimental, at the moment. Untested on 6100L and 6200L.

Usage Problems
==============
*) What linux distribution does it work on?

  See ***Requirement*** above.

  Failure (too old): RH 7.1 (gs 5.50), RH 7.2 (?), ASPLinux 7.2

  Developers' choices: Slackware 8.1 (HTL), Redhat 8.0/9 (RR)
 
  Reported Success: SuSE 7.3 (FE), Mandrake 9.0 (CS), Debian 3.0 (JM), 
                    SuSE 8.0 (HS), Mandrake 8.2 (AC)

  The code has reportedly been ported successfully to FreeBSD and Solaris 10.

*) "ijs_server_epsonepl: command not found"
   "Can't start ijs server "ijs_server_epsonepl""
   CUPS webgui: "foomatic-rip failed"
   CUPS error: Could not execute ijs_server_epsonepl, permission debied

  The binary 'ijs_server_epsonepl' needs to be in your $PATH. Check your 
  $PATH variable with "echo $PATH", and/or verify with 
  'which ijs_server_epsonepl'. Copy the binary into /usr/bin as last resort. 

  In most cases the problem is that ijs_server_epsonepl is in /usr/local/bin
  and /usr/local/bin is not in your $PATH.

*) "Unknown device: ijs"
   
   See ***Requirement*** above.

*) "I want CUPS support"
   
   There are some foomatic data in the foomatic sub-directory. If you have 
   foomatic installed, you can generates PPD files for CUPS. Browse the
   user mailing list archive for clues (link at the bottom of 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/).

*) "I can't get this f#$%&ing thing to work"

   Browse the user mailing list archive for clues (link at the bottom of 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/).
   
*) The print out is slight displaced.

   The default paper size for CUPS is "letter" (a lot of US-based
   print-related software, including ghostscript itself, and e.g. 
   most M$ windows driver for HP printers, defaults to "letter"). 
   Many things can happen if you have "letter" declared somewhere
   and "A4" elsewhere, and vice versa.

   A4 is 17pt narrower (about 1/4 inch or 6mm), and 50 pt longer (17mm).

   Try to save the postscript file your application generates.
   The top a postscript file contains these two lines:

      %!PS-Adobe-3.0
      %%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792 

   (612, 792) is letter. (595, 842) is A4. These numbers are in pt's 
   (= 1/72 inch, a traditional type-setter's measure).

*) The printer crashes during operation.

   There are a few known reasons for this to happen. Almost all of
   them are properly avoided by the code, with a few exceptions:
   - Printing very complex pages (full size dithered photos) at
     high resolution, because the memory in the printer is not enough.
     Only solution is add a SIMM to the printer or use a lower resolution.
     Automatic decreasing of resolution is theorically possible, but
     not implemented.
   - Internal buffer overflow. Flow control (only available with USB)
     avoids this problem on 5800L/5900L (and on 5700L in most cases).

*) USB operation with CUPS 1.3.x

   Some user reports that it works better configuring CUPS with the 
   parallel port backend but against a USB device, rather than letting 
   CUPS auto-detect. i.e.
         As 'device-URI', enter 'parallel:/dev/usb/lp0'
  instead of letting CUPS decide (USB:...)
     
*) CUPS complains that the PPD is broken
   cupstestppd is a tool that can test for conformance. If in doubt,
   regenerates the PPDs in 'foomatic_PPDs' using one of the scripts
   'foomatic_scripts' as example, against the latest foomatic.
   cups has gone progressively tighter with its PPD conformance test,
   so a PPD that works alright with and earlier verion of CUPS can
   suddenly fail after a CUPS upgrade. cupstestppd should provide
   guidelines for how to modify a ppd to make it work, if the latest
   foomatic doesn't already do the correct job.
   *** Note: you should shutdown cups before editing /etc/cups/ppd/* .
